# app-swap
- This is a bot for Destiny Linked. This bot runs solely on 1 machine, so downtime is to be expected.
- What this bot does thus far is take messages sent in the #character-application channel and post it into a mod-only channel so that applications can be reviewed with ease.

# upcoming functionality
- Plans to add a command to send messages into #character-discussion when applications are approved
- Plans to read application status via reaction images to automatically send a message into #character-discussion
- A command to choose between an offered list of items
